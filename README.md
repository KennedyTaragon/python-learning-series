# Python Learning Series

This repository documents my journey of learning Python â€” from the very basics to more advanced programming concepts.  
Each folder includes example scripts and exercises for hands-on practice and deeper understanding.

## Structure
Example folder organization (will grow as learning progresses):


## Topics Covered (So Far)
- Python Syntax  
- Variables and Data Types  
- Control Flow  
- Functions  

## Goal
To gradually build a complete collection of Python examples and exercises as I learn the language step by step.

## How to Run
Run any file using:
```bash
python3 filename.py
